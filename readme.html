<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================

Pathfinding Implementation
----------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Pathfinding data type.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?

Briefly explain how you represented the search node PFNode.

Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->

My Pathfinding implementation uses a helper class PFNode to represent the coordinates in
the terrain in a way that keeps track of all the individual paths. `PFNode` keeps track its source
node so that the path can easily be retraced. I also used a double array of PFNodes to keep
track of whether a certain location has already been searched.

I use a helper class called PFNode to represent a search node. It keeps track of its current
location, its cost, and the node it comes from. When the node is created, I calculate its cost
and store it within the `PFNode`. When `getCost()` is called, I access the previous node's cost
and implement the heuristic cost.

My `computePath()` function implements the A* search algorithm. For each given tile, I
scan all the surrounding neighbors and, if they are valid tiles, I save them as a valid path,
including their cost. I then search the minimum cost path and continue until either a path
from start to end is found or until there are no search options left. Once the path is found, I
save the ending node and create a Stack of Coords representing the path, which is
returned as an iterable of coords. All functions in PFNode run in constant time except for
`computePath()`.



Walker Implementation
-----------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Walker data type.
How did you test the correctness of your algorithm?
-->

The `Walker.java` class is passed a terrain and iterable of coords representing the path. I use a
Queue to represent the path. Each time `advance()` is called, I move through as much cost as allowed by
`byTime`, keeping track of how far I go if I don't end exactly at a point in the
path. This implementation works for any value of `STEPS_TO_WALK` and for any path cost.



Analysis
=============

<!--
For each of the following maps and given the default starting and ending locations, give the estimated travel cost ($\text{cost}_0(E)$) and search size for different heuristic values ($h$).
-->

<!--
Given the information above, do you notice any patterns?
Is there a value of $h$ that seems to work best?
-->





Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!-- Details and screenshots here -->
I did not find any bugs or limitations.





Reflection
===========

Critical Thinking
-------------------

<!--
Did you use any of the CT Skills?
If so, which ones did you use, and how did you use them?
If not, explain what you did when you needed help.
Or, did you not need help?

- consulting an expert
- asking good questions
- edge cases
- similar problems / fewer variables
- developing subgoals


What did you do to monitor your progress and make sure you did not spend more time than necessary on this assignment?
-->

I used consulting an expert and asking good questions to understand what needed to be
done for the `Walker.java` class. I also used similar problems / fewer variables to simplify the
pathfinding algorithm during the early stages of development.


Help
-----------

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

<!-- ... -->
I received help from Dr. Denning on some of the details of my `Walker.java` implementation.
I also discussed with some fellow students what the end goal was for the `Walker.java` class,
as I was having trouble understanding the instructions for that class. I used whiteboarding
many times to flesh out the details of my algorithm.




<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->

<!-- ... -->
While I discussed the criteria of the problem with my peers, all my code was developed and
tested by me.



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

<!-- ... -->
My two biggest struggles on this project were initially figuring out all the different
components provided to us by Dr. Denning and understanding the intended function of the
`Walker.java` class. A majority of my time was spent debugging code and thinking about
details of the algorithm. This project was tough, but I enjoyed it and very much look
forward to the next one.
